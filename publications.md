    **Abstract:** How does group consciousness affect the preferences for district selection? In this paper, we investigate if individuals that have a stronger group consciousness measured as historical discrimination, existences of linked fate, and inequalities in the treatment of different racial groups affect district choice. Using a multi-method design, using semi-structured interviews and a conjoint experiment in a sample of Afro-Colombians, we find evidence that group consciousness affects the preferences for ethnic districts over territorial ones. Our results also show that membership to ethnic organization or individuals episodes of discrimination do not change preferences for ethnic districts. These findings indicate that individuals with high levels of group consciousness tend to worry more about mechanisms ad institutions that can enhance the group's political representation.

    **Abstract:** How does extortion affect political and civic engagement? Extortion is both a form of victimization and a type of economic hardship, yet existing literature is inconclusive about how both phenomena affect public participation. We argue that extortion as an economic shock will increase grievances, thereby increasing engagement. In contrast, extortion as victimization will prompt fear of crime, thereby depressing engagement. Using novel survey data from migrants deported to Guatemala by the U.S. government, we leverage the quasi-random experience of extortion during migration to test this theory. We find that extortion has a strong positive effect on both civic action and protest after deportation. The results suggest that this effect is mediated partly by increased economic hardship. These findings demonstrate that extortion experienced while migrating has long term financial consequences for deportees which may ultimately shape their reintegration into their home countries.

    <p> <sub>
    **Abstract:** In addition to the threat of serious illness, COVID-19 and subsequent restrictions had devastating economic consequences for many US citizens. This study examines the evolution of food security over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic testing whether the initial economic stimulus payment improved the nutritional well-being of vulnerable populations. We use data from Phase 1 of the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey among a nationally representative sample of adults and the 2017-2018 Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement. Using an ordered logistic regression, we assess differences in the incidence and severity of food security across demographic, income, geographic and employment status cohorts and assess the effects of the first economic stimulus payment. Our results show that marginalized groups faced greater food insecurity and had food-related outcomes worsen over time. Blacks, Hispanics, and individuals living in rural areas became less food secure as the pandemic progressed. However, receipt of a stimulus payment appears to have improved conditions. Rising food prices and persistent high unemployment have the potential to exacerbate food insecurity among marginalized and at-risk groups.

    <p> <sub>
    **Abstract:** The positive relationship between economic precarity and increased preferences for redistribution is well-established in a large literature focusing on the Global North. However, existing scholarship finds no relationship between precarity and redistribution in the Global South; the underlying reasons remain unclear. Moreover, existing papers conflate precarity and informality, thus confounding the interpretation of these results. We conducted a priming experiment and leveraged the COVID-19 pandemic to randomly vary perceptions of economic precarity for 1,526 individuals in Metro Manila, Philippines. We show that precarity is not correlated with increased demand for redistribution, but is correlated with a preference for non-contributory social assistance spending over contributory social insurance spending. This result is driven by the formal sector, suggesting that precarity does engender different views about redistribution among individuals with exposure to different social spending policies.

    <details><summary markdown="span"> Migrant Risky Business: Politicians and vote buying in Colombia *Under Review* </summary>
    <p> <sub>
    **Abstract:** The number of internal migrants in the developing world has been increasing due to climate change, violence, and economic development. How do these flows of migrants affect politicians' use of vote-buying? Unlike their international counterparts, internal migrants still retain their right to vote and hence can participate in elections. This paper presents a theory analyzing a politician's decision when allocating private benefits between migrants and natives. Using Colombia as a case study, this paper illustrates that politicians will distribute more private benefits to migrants when there are lower levels of political competition. This result is driven by the fact that migrants present a riskier investment for politicians. Results also show that low political turnout in high-migration areas is associated with less mobilization targeting. These findings complement the results from the lack of migrant integration into formal political settings as campaigns and candidacies by looking at informal distributional channels.

    <p> <sub>
    **Abstract:** During armed conflicts, combatants forge deep ties with peers and leaders that often persist post-war. There is a growing consensus that these ties are a negative influence on ex-combatants, facilitating a return to arms or pulling former fighters into organized crime. We present suggestive evidence that this view may be overly pessimistic. We collect rare survey and qualitative interview data from demobilized fighters going through an economic reintegration program in Colombia. We find no evidence that ex-combatants who are actively attempting reintegration are influenced by wartime ties and some evidence that they \textit{discount} information from former fighters. Our results speak to the potential for ex-combatants to vary in their personal investment in demobilization and how state policies can structure ex-combatant decision-making.

    <p> <sub>
    **Abstract:** Urban economic growth often entails transformation that displaces vulnerable residents. As developing countries rapidly urbanize, millions living in informal settlements face eviction each year, often without notice or alternative arrangements upon displacement. Yet strikingly little quantitative evidence exists on which communities are displaced in the name of modernization and why. This article examines evictions in Patna, Bihar, India, using five data sources: administrative surveys of slums, pre-eviction household surveys, post-eviction interviews with local informants, panel satellite imagery, and novel geospatial data on economic activity. We find that officials primarily targeted the poorest settlements located on the least economically valuable land. Four years later, these sites were rarely redeveloped. Evictions were ordered by higher-level officials, and local political ties did not prevent displacement. Our findings collectively support the logic that higher-level officials order evictions to assert their authority in a context of complex overlapping jurisdictions, rather than for economic development purposes.

    **Abstract:** Climate change is a global emergency, requiring both technological and institutional interventions to mitigate its effects. Among the contributions of political science to climate action are institutional solutions that address collective action problems, such as collective property rights. Accordingly, collective titling became a prominent conservation strategy in recent decades. However, empirical evidence on its effectiveness remains inconclusive, with inconsistent findings often lacking clear the- oretical explanations. We bridge this gap by arguing that the impact of collective titling depends on the strength of intracommunity institutions – where communities with more cohesive institutions experience solider conservation outcomes, as suggested by the common-pool resource literature. We test this argument by analyzing the effects of collective titling programs on deforestation in Brazil. We find that while collective titling reduces degradation, its benefits are concentrated in communi- ties with strong pre-existing collective institutions, highlighting a more nuanced reality than is often assumed in the policy literature.

    <p> <sub>
    **Abstract:** Urban economic growth is often associated with transformation and beautification in the name of development. However, to build new roads or create green space, city planners transform the preexisting urban environment. This process creates winners and losers, and often involves the eviction and displacement of poor households. In this paper, we investigate how governments decide whom to displace, and whom to leave untouched, in the name of modernization. Drawing on a unique combination of pre-eviction surveys, post-eviction interviews, and novel geospatial data, we analyze the case of slums in Patna, Bihar, the capital of India’s poorest state. We find that evictions are negatively associated with the economic value of the areas where slums are situated, and, contrary to our expectations, that strong local political connectedness does not prevent eviction.

    <p> <sub>
    **Abstract:** Political corruption diminishes democratic accountability and leads to economic inefficiencies, yet voters all over the world vote for corrupt politicians. What explains this phenomenon? This letter argues that corruption takes different forms and, in turn, has different effects on public support. We conduct a survey experiment on voters in the Philippines to examine how type of corruption affects their support for politicians. The results display a corruption ordering. Relative to no corruption, respondents who received the nepotism treatment are 21.6 percentage points less likely to vote for the mayor, respondents receiving the bribery treatment 35 p.p. less likely, and those receiving the theft treatment 50 p.p. less likely. These results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications and are consistent with theories of social distance and different norms and values as potential explanations. Our results suggest that type of corruption is a key determinant of corrupt politicians' electoral success.

    **Abstract:** How can we encourage youth participation in politics? Previous scholarship on youth political participation has primarily focused on the impact of educational attainment and civic education programs on electoral engagement, potentially overlooking the fundamental origins of political interest. Additionally, existing research has not adequately addressed when and how political interest develops in young people. We argue that prediction-like markets can generate dispositional interest in politics among young voters, as betting will encourage them to engage with political information and increase their likelihood of voting. To test this hypothesis, we use an experimental design to investigate whether allowing participants to update their bets about local mayoral elections incentivizes them to seek information and improve their electoral predictions. Our results indicate that participants who could update their bets demonstrated increased political interest and more accurate predictions compared to both final election results and average poll predictions. While subsidizing initial bets had minimal overall impact, it interestingly led to decreased political interest among those who could update their bets, suggesting that updating was a costly activity for participants. Furthermore, subgroup analysis reveals that men generally showed higher political interest and were more responsive to subsidies in their predictions.

    **Abstract:** Policymakers are increasingly concerned about the revival of superpower conflict. Increased competition among great powers has been especially evident in the exercise of foreign influence, where Russia and China have increased their efforts to influence less powerful nations. To date, the absence of quantitative data has limited systematic investigation of this resurgence of authoritarian influence activity. We introduce a new, country-month dataset tracking reports of influence by Russia and China in 62 aid-receiving countries from 2012 through 2024. We construct the data by applying large langauage models (LLMs) to an original corpus of more than 100 million news articles sourced from high-quality, domestic news sources and use it to describe trends in influence activity over time and across countries. Finally, we exploit the unique features of the data to test hypotheses about Russian influence activity in the months before the invasion of Ukraine. We document a dramatic increase in the use of diplomacy, economic power, and hard power before the invasion. In doing so, we show that this data is useful for both theory testing and foreign policy decision-making.

    **Abstract:** Elections are events where democratic ideals are forged into tangible political outcomes. They’re the source of a government’s right to lead and the key factor in balancing power among different groups in society. However, these pivotal events can also present opportunities for aspiring autocrats. Such leaders may exploit elections to restrict civic space, weaken opposition forces, or further consolidate power. This concern is particularly relevant because most democratic backsliding is initiated by aspiring autocrats who come to power via elections, sometimes via narrow electoral victories.[1][5] Using high-frequency data from the Machine Learning for Peace (MLP) project, we provide unique evidence on the extent to which backsliding regimes differ from their liberal democratic counterparts in their treatment of civic space around elections

    **Abstract:** How does extortion experienced during the migration journey affect the civic engagement of deported migrants returned to their home country?  More broadly, how does extortion affect political participation? We know very little about either the political behavior of returnees or about how coercive economic shocks experienced during migration affect subsequent levels of political participation. Furthermore, existing literature on how victimization affects political participation is inconclusive, particularly when combined with existing work on economic insecurity. Studying deported migrants and the quasi-random experience of extortion enables us to address the endogeneity that often confounds these analyses. This approach allows us to isolate the impact of extortion on political action from potentially confounding factors related to local security or corruption. Using a novel dataset from Guatemalan migrants returned to Guatemala by the U.S. government, we find that extortion has a direct, positive relationship with multiple forms of civic action, and that, at least in this context, the mobilizing effects of economic hardship outweigh the potentially demobilizing effects of fear of crime.

    **Abstract:** Education is a powerful tool for social mobility and cultural integration. However, it is one of the largest hurdles for migrants—particularly for forcefully displaced migrants, given their more vulnerable condition and lack of resources to pay for private education. This paper explores educational gaps between migrants and natives in Chile, a country that provides free public education to newcomers. The paper analyzes an administrative data set that includes all students in the Chilean educational system and follows students from 2017 to 2018. Using a research discontinuity design around the cut-off for financial aid to tertiary education, this paper investigates whether access to financial aid generates incentives for forced migrants to enroll in tertiary education. This research confirms previous findings that show that migrants have lower advancement and enrollment rates than natives at every school level. Moreover, it f inds that financial aid applications constitute a major roadblock preventing migrant students from accessing higher education. Furthermore, the paper presents suggestive evidence showing that the interaction between the type of school (vocational vs. technical) and the migrant condition affects applications for financial aid.
