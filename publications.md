    <details><summary markdown="span">Doves, Hawks, and Turnout: The Electoral Effects of Targeted Post-Conflict Political Violence **with** [Gabriella Levy](https://gabriellalevy.net/). *Under Review*</summary>
    <p> <sub>
    *Abstract:* What are the effects of violence against civic leaders and ex-combatants on electoral outcomes in unstable contexts emerging from conflict? Such individuals have been targeted in a range of countries, including Colombia and Afghanistan. Yet, existing research on wartime and electoral violence has rarely explored the killings of these non-combatants, who are neither regular people nor powerful politicians. Thus, we examine the relationship between 1) the deaths of social leaders and demobilized ex-combatants in Colombia following the 2016 peace agreement and 2) Colombian political participation and vote choice in 2018 and 2019 elections. Methodologically, we use a series of municipal level estimations followed by individual level regressions using DANE survey data from the Colombian government. Our results indicate that social leader and ex-combatant assassinations each reduce political engagement as well as support for the hawkish candidate. We also provide suggestive evidence that the assassinations not only reduce citizens' perceptions of their personal security but also increase their belief in the value of violence and depress their satisfaction with the state of democracy in their country. These results suggest that, through their impact on electoral participation, vote choice, and public attitudes, the assassinations may have countervailing effects on national stability.

    <details><summary markdown="span"> Between locals and migrants: Politicians and vote buying in Colombia *Working Paper* </summary>
    <p> <sub>
    *Abstract:* The number of internal migrants in the developing world has been increasing as a result of climate change, violence and economic development. How do these flows of migrants affect vote-buying structures? Unlike their international counterparts, internal migrants still retain their right to vote and hence could be included in vote-buying schemes. This paper uses a formal model to analyze the decision a politician makes when allocating private benefits between migrants and natives. The model indicates that politicians will distribute private benefits to migrants when there is  a low level of political competition. Using individual and municipal quantitative data from Colombia alongside  qualitative work, I find that migrants engage less in vote-buying practices in more competitive environments. This result is most likely the effect of migrant turnout rather than issues with migrant voting registration. The results also show that vote-buying interactions between politicians and migrants are one shot leaving aside the idea of relational clientelism. Finally, political competition reduces the amount of private benefits distributed by local political machines. These findings complement the results from migrant integration into formal political settings as campaigns and candidacies.

    <details><summary markdown="span"> Precarity, and Preferences for Redistribution in Weak States: Evidence from the Philippines **with** [Dean Dulay](https://www.deandulay.com/) and [Janica Magat](https://janicamagat.com/) *Working Paper* </summary>
    <p> <sub>
    *Abstract:* The positive relationship between economic precarity and increased preferences for redistribution is well-established in a large literature focusing on the Global North. However, existing scholarship finds no relationship between precarity and redistribution in the Global South; the underlying reasons remain unclear. Moreover, existing papers conflate precarity and informality, thus confounding the interpretation of these results. We conducted a priming experiment and leveraged the COVID-19 pandemic to randomly vary perceptions of economic precarity for 1,526 individuals in Metro Manila, Philippines. We show that precarity is not correlated with increased demand for redistribution, but is correlated with a preference for non-contributory social assistance spending over contributory social insurance spending. This result is driven by the formal sector, suggesting that precarity does engender different views about redistribution among individuals with exposure to different social spending policies.

    <details><summary markdown="span"> Forced Displacement of Migrants, Social Cohesion, and Political Engagement **with** [Elaine K. Denny](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/edenny/), [David A. Dow](https://sites.google.com/view/davidadow/home) and [Gabriella Levy](https://gabriellalevy.net/). *Working Paper* </summary>
    <p> <sub>
    *Abstract:* How does extortion experienced during the migration journey affect the civic engagement of deported migrants returned to their home country?  More broadly, how does extortion affect political participation? We know very little about either the political behavior of returnees or about how coercive economic shocks experienced during migration affect subsequent levels of political participation. Furthermore, existing literature on how victimization affects political participation is inconclusive, particularly when combined with existing work on economic insecurity. Studying deported migrants and the quasi-random experience of extortion enables us to address the endogeneity that often confounds these analyses. This approach allows us to isolate the impact of extortion on political action from potentially confounding factors related to local security or corruption. Using a novel dataset from Guatemalan migrants returned to Guatemala by the U.S. government, we find that extortion has a direct, positive relationship with multiple forms of civic action, and that, at least in this context, the mobilizing effects of economic hardship outweigh the potentially demobilizing effects of fear of crime.

    <details><summary markdown="span"> Educational integration of forced migrants in Chile **with** Christian Blanco and [Francisco Meneses](https://fjmenese.github.io/). *Working Paper* </summary>
    <p> <sub>
    *Abstract:* Education is a powerful tool for social mobility and cultural integration. However, it is one of the largest hurdles for migrants and particularly for forcefully displaced migrants given their more vulnerable condition and the lack of resources to pay for private education. In this paper we explore when do of the gaps between migrants and natives appear in Chile, a country who provides free education for newcomers in public schools. We use administrative data sets for all students in the Chilean educational system and follow students between years 2017 and 2018. Moreover, we use a research discontinuity design around the cut-off for financial aid to tertiary education to investigate if access to financial aid generates incentives for forced migrants to enroll in tertiary education. We confirm previous findings that show that migrants have lower advancement and enrollment rates when compared to natives at every school level. We find that financial aid application is a major roadblock for migrants students to access higher education. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that migrants in general education schools who register for financial aid tend to increase their higher educational enrollment, while this effect is not significant for migrants in the vocational track.
