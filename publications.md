    <details><summary markdown="span">Doves, Hawks, and Turnout: The Electoral Effects of Targeted Post-Conflict Political Violence **with** [Gabriella Levy](https://gabriellalevy.net/). *Under Review*</summary>
    <p> <sub>
    *Abstract:* What are the effects of violence against civic leaders and ex-combatants on electoral outcomes in unstable contexts emerging from conflict? Such individuals have been targeted in a range of countries, including Colombia and Afghanistan. Yet, existing research on wartime and electoral violence has rarely explored the killings of these non-combatants, who are neither regular people nor powerful politicians. Thus, we examine the relationship between 1) the deaths of social leaders and demobilized ex-combatants in Colombia following the 2016 peace agreement and 2) Colombian political participation and vote choice in 2018 and 2019 elections. Methodologically, we use a series of municipal level estimations followed by individual level regressions using DANE survey data from the Colombian government. Our results indicate that social leader and ex-combatant assassinations each reduce political engagement as well as support for the hawkish candidate. We also provide suggestive evidence that the assassinations not only reduce citizens' perceptions of their personal security but also increase their belief in the value of violence and depress their satisfaction with the state of democracy in their country. These results suggest that, through their impact on electoral participation, vote choice, and public attitudes, the assassinations may have countervailing effects on national stability.

    <details><summary markdown="span"> Between locals and migrants: Politicians and vote buying in Colombia *Working Paper* </summary>
    <p> <sub>
    *Abstract:* The number of internal migrants in the developing world has been increasing as a result of climate change, violence and economic development. How do these flows of migrants affect vote-buying structures? Unlike their international counterparts, internal migrants still retain their right to vote and hence could be included in vote-buying schemes. This paper uses a formal model to analyze the decision a politician makes when allocating private benefits between migrants and natives. The model indicates that politicians will distribute private benefits to migrants when there is  a low level of political competition. Using individual and municipal quantitative data from Colombia alongside  qualitative work, I find that migrants engage less in vote-buying practices in more competitive environments. This result is most likely the effect of migrant turnout rather than issues with migrant voting registration. The results also show that vote-buying interactions between politicians and migrants are one shot leaving aside the idea of relational clientelism. Finally, political competition reduces the amount of private benefits distributed by local political machines. These findings complement the results from migrant integration into formal political settings as campaigns and candidacies.
