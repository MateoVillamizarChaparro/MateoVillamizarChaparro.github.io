<!-- ## Professional Experience -->
Prior to arriving at Duke, I worked for Microsoft Azure in Seattle and Beijing. From 2014 to 2018, I was in charge of constructing the internal analytics for Microsoft Azure China. My reports informed company financials and earnings reports, as well as internal decisions on datacenter capacity, marketing campaigns, and supply chain improvements. This role involved spending one week a month on the ground in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong from 2014 to 2016. I then relocated to Beijing full-time from 2016 to 2018.
