<!-- ## Education  -->
My undergraduate degrees are in Mathematics (with Honors) and Chinese from the College of William & Mary. I studied Chinese language at Tsinghua University in 2010 and throughout my several years living in China.

At William & Mary, my Mathematics Honors Thesis modeled oyster repopulation efforts in the Chesapeake Bay. My Chinese senior thesis analyzed the relationship between Chinese state-owned enterprises and the central government. I studied Chinese Language and Literature at Tsinghua University in the summer of 2010.

At Duke, I specialize in political economy and quantitative methods. I have taken coursework in the Political Science, Economics, Mathematics, and Public Policy departments. I am a Research Associate in Devlab@Duke working on the Machine Learning for Peace project. Our team is predicting civil space movements across the world using data scraped from news stories online. We then apply a supervised classifier to find relevant events and forecast movements particular to each country.
