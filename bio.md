<!-- ## Bio -->

At Duke, I specialize in political economy and quantitative methods. I have taken coursework in the Political Science, Economics, Mathematics, and Public Policy departments. I am a Research Associate in [Devlab@Duke](https://www.devlabduke.com/) working on the Machine Learning for Peace project. Our team is predicting civil space movements across the world using data scraped from news stories online. We then apply a supervised classifier to find relevant events and forecast movements particular to each country. See our [github](https://github.com/ssdorsey/news-please) for our news retrieval product.

Prior to arriving at Duke, I worked for Microsoft Azure in Seattle and Beijing. From 2014 to 2018, I was in charge of constructing the internal analytics for Microsoft Azure China. My reports informed company financials and earnings reports, as well as internal decisions on datacenter capacity, marketing campaigns, and supply chain improvements. This role involved spending one week a month on the ground in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong from 2014 to 2016. I then relocated to Beijing full-time from 2016 to 2018.

My undergraduate degrees are in Mathematics (with Honors) and Chinese from the College of William & Mary. My Mathematics Honors Thesis modeled oyster repopulation efforts in the Chesapeake Bay. After studying Chinese language at Tsinghua University, my Chinese senior thesis analyzed the relationship between Chinese state-owned enterprises and the central government.
