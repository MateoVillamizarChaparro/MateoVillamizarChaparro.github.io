<!-- ## Bio -->

I am a PhD candidate in Duke University's department of Political Science focusing on political economy. Previously, I completed a master’s in International Affairs (UC- San Diego) and another in Political Science (Universidad de los Andes). I hold undergraduate degrees in both Economics and Political Science form Universidad de los Andes. I'm a research associate at [DevLab@Penn](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dev-lab/) and one of the organizers of the [Duke/UNC Latin American Working Group](https://lacsconsortium.org/latin-american-politics-working-group/). I'm originally from Bogotá, Colombia.

My research interests are at the intersections between representation, political participation, development economics and migration in developing countries. My dissertation proposal revolves around the strategic interaction between politicians and internal migrants in terms of political participation and public good distribution.

Besides academia, I have also worked as a consultant to the Colombian Ministry of Labor and as a research assistant at [Fundación Ideas para la Paz](http://www.ideaspaz.org/) and [Congreso Visible](https://congresovisible.uniandes.edu.co/).
