Welcome! I am currently a PhD candidate in Duke University's department of Political Science. Starting in August, I will be an Assitant Professor at the Department of Social Sciences at Universidad Católica de Uruguay. Previously, I completed a master’s in International Affairs (UC- San Diego) and another in Political Science (Universidad de los Andes). My research explores the relationship between migration, inequality, and political participation in Latin America. In exploring these themes, I employ various methods to gather and analyze data. Methodologically, I employ advanced regression techniques as well as experimental and quasi-experimental methods. I have also collected a diverse range of original data, including originally digitized archives, fieldwork, surveys, and web scrapping.

Currently, I'm a research associate at [DevLab@Penn](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dev-lab/) in the [Machine Learning for Peace Project](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/mlp-devlab/) and one of the organizers of the [Duke/UNC Latin American Working Group](https://lacsconsortium.org/latin-american-politics-working-group/). I have published my work in the *British Journal of Political Science*, the *Journal of Ethnic and Health Disparities*, and *Editorial Uniandes*. My research has been funded by Innovations for Poverty Action, USAID, the World Bank, the Social Science Research Council, and Duke University.
