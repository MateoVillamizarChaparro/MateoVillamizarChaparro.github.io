Welcome! I am currently a PhD candidate in Duke University's department of Political Science. Previously, I completed a masterâ€™s in International Affairs (UC- San Diego) and another in Political Science (Universidad de los Andes). I'm interested in studying the politics of public goods distribution and violence in developing countries. With an emphasis in economic development, migration, state capacity and political institutions. Currently, I'm a research associate at [DevLab@Penn](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dev-lab/) in the [Machine Learning for Peace Project](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/mlp-devlab/) and one of the organizers of the [Duke/UNC Latin American Working Group](https://lacsconsortium.org/latin-american-politics-working-group/). My research has been published or is forthcoming at the British Journal of Political Science, Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities and Editorial Uniandes. My research has been funded by SSRC and JPAL.
