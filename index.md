Welcome! I am currently a third year PhD candidate in Duke University's department of Political Science focusing on in political economy. Previously, I completed a masterâ€™s in International Affairs (UC- San Diego) and another in Political Science (Universidad de los Andes). I'm a member of [DevLab@Duke](https://www.devlabduke.com/). My research interests include analyzing the politics of public goods distribution and violence in developing countries. With an emphasis in economic development, migration, state capacity and political institutions.
