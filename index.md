Welcome! I am a computational political economist currently in the third year of my PhD in Duke University's department of Political Science. My research employs quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze the connection between government financing, household economics, and political participation. I also study the relationship between international organizations and countriesâ€™ decision-making processes during conflicts.
