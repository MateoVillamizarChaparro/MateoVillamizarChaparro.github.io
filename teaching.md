title: Teaching

As a teacher, my twin objectives are to foster curiosity about real-world political dynamics and equip students with the methodological skills to analyze those dynamics scientifically. To accomplish this objective, my teaching philosophy rests upon three fundamental pillars. Firstly, I prioritize the development of students' analytical and problem-solving abilities through writing exercises and data literacy. Second, I cultivate my students’ curiosity and participation by fostering inclusive learning environments. Lastly, I aim to inspire teamwork and a genuine interest in their work through project-based and experiential learning approaches.

I am eager to teach undergraduate and graduate courses on comparative politics, political economy, and migration. Additionally, I am enthusiastic about teaching more specialized classes on the political economy of Latin America, race and representation, and distributive politics. On the methods front, I can offer specialized courses on research design, causal inference, archival and field research, as well as basic regression, maximum likelihood, and econometrics. I am committed to designing undergraduate courses that provide students with opportunities to apply their knowledge to real-world contexts, while graduate courses help to facilitate the development and advancement of students' research agendas. You can find my syllabus for the PE of migration [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5gllbe6mpimizw4pdyr6o/Sample-Syllabus.pdf?rlkey=59hwd9l0tpfwus9i8y21msyta&dl=0).
